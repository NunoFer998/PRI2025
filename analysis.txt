Additionally, I've been experiencing mild to moderate cognitive problems. I've also observed some distinct facial features, such as a belly button that sticks out, a top portion of the ear that's folded over slightly, and a small nose with nostrils tipped forward. My eyes are wide-set with droopy eyelids, and I have a poorly developed middle section of the face. I've also noticed a wide groove above my upper lip and a crease below my lower lip. Furthermore, my hands and feet are small and broad with short fingers and curved-in fifth fingers, and my toes are short with mild webbing. I've also had delayed teeth and a scrotum that surrounds my penis, giving it a "shawl scrotum" appearance. My hairline has a "widow's peak" shape, and I've experienced delayed sexual maturity. Overall, I have a rounded face with a downward palpebral slant to my eyes, and I'm slightly shorter than average, which wasn't noticeable until I was around 1 to 3 years old.

Additionally, my ears are deformed, and my skin is quite pale. I've also noticed that I have triple-jointed thumbs, which is quite unusual. Furthermore, I was born with a cleft palate, and I've struggled with an inability to fully extend my joints since birth.

I've been experiencing some disturbing gastrointestinal symptoms lately, including diarrhea and occasional vomiting blood, which is really alarming me. Along with this, I've been struggling with severe esophageal reflux symptoms, which are making my life miserable. To make matters worse, I've been dealing with persistent abdominal pain that's been really uncomfortable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1
I've been noticing some unusual physical characteristics in myself, including a mildly sunken chest and undescended testicles. Additionally, I've been experiencing mild to moderate cognitive problems. I've also observed some distinct facial features, such as a belly button that sticks out, a top portion of the ear that's folded over slightly, and a small nose with nostrils tipped forward. My eyes are wide-set with droopy eyelids, and I have a poorly developed middle section of the face. I've also noticed a wide groove above my upper lip and a crease below my lower lip. Furthermore, my hands and feet are small and broad with short fingers and curved-in fifth fingers, and my toes are short with mild webbing. I've also had delayed teeth and a scrotum that surrounds my penis, giving it a "shawl scrotum" appearance. My hairline has a "widow's peak" shape, and I've experienced delayed sexual maturity. Overall, I have a rounded face with a downward palpebral slant to my eyes, and I'm slightly shorter than average, which wasn't noticeable until I was around 1 to 3 years old.    1
I've been aware of some unusual physical characteristics that have been concerning me, including my narrow shoulders, droopy eyelids, and absent or small knuckles. Additionally, my ears are deformed, and my skin is quite pale. I've also noticed that I have triple-jointed thumbs, which is quite unusual. Furthermore, I was born with a cleft palate, and I've struggled with an inability to fully extend my joints since birth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
I've been experiencing some alarming symptoms lately, including passing out and frequent dizziness. I have severe, sudden, and persistent pain in my abdomen or back that sometimes spreads to my groin, buttocks, or legs. I've also been dealing with nausea and vomiting. Additionally, I've noticed signs of shock, such as clammy skin and a rapid heart rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1
I've been experiencing some concerning symptoms related to my menstrual cycle, including tenderness and dryness of the vagina, as well as heavier bleeding, which has led to me passing large clots, needing to change my protection during the night, and soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every hour for 2 to 3 hours in a row. Along with these physical symptoms, I've also been experiencing mood swings. My periods have become irregular, occurring less than 28 days apart or more than 35 days apart, and I've noticed bleeding or spotting from the vagina between periods. Additionally, I've developed excessive growth of body hair in a male pattern, which is quite distressing. I've also been experiencing hot flashes, and my bleeding has been lasting for more days than normal, often exceeding 7 days. To make matters more complicated, the time between my periods has been changing each month, making it difficult for me to predict when my next period will be.                                                                                                                            1
